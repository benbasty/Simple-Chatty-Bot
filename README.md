# Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe
## Description

Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. <br>
In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk. <br>
In this project, we will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming. <br>

## Stages
**Stage 1: Chatty Bot welcomes you**
<br> Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console. <br>

**Stage 2: Print your name**
<br> Introduce yourself to the bot. <br>

**Stage 3: Guess the age**
<br> Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age <br>

**Stage 4: Learning numbers**
<br> Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage! <br>

**Stage 5: Multiple Choice**
<br> At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better. <br>
